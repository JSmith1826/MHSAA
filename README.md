### Data Sources:
- MHSAA.com
    - School Info
    - game level data for each sport
    ##### MHSAA Website
    - Started by Scraping for valid school IDs
    - Scraping valid IDs for game level data
        - game level data
            - the original method of scraping every team individually did yeild better overall data (including league names and info on weither each game was a league game or a non loeague game)
                - That type of data could be used to get insights about the strength of a league relative to others
        - school info dataframe
    - Found better way to get data one year/sport at a time.
